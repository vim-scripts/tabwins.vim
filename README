1 command for immediate access to customized window structures 
and content ~during~ Vim sessions.

The Developer 
  - Avoids hit-or-miss, time-consuming, manual, repetitious 
    runs of :split/:vsplit, and thought-sinks about how 
    to produce an intended window structure

  - Avoids losing current configurations due to mid-session 
    reloads of backed-up Vim sessions that have preferred
    window structures

  - Avoids loss of focus from these discontinuities


FORMS 

  :{Tabwins cmd}   {window_dimensions}; {fill_spec,...};  {tab_option, ...}
  :{symmetric cmd}                                         {fill_spec,...};  {tab_option, ...}

  Where
      :{Tabwins cmd}   is any of :Tabwins, :TabwinsVertical, :TabwinsHorizontal
      :{symmetric cmd} is any of the form :{V|H}IxJ or :{V|H}I 

  Semicolons separate arg groups, commas separate inside groups.

  {window_dimensions} is the only mandatory arg, only in :{Tabwins cmd}

  The "Usage" Section in tabwins.txt has more detail. 


EXAMPLES

  >> Empty Windows 

  :Tabwins 1211 
  " For a new tab of 4 columns of 1, 2, 1, & 1 windows successively
  " left to right, with buffers empty.

  :TabwinsHorizontal 4221 
  " For a new tab of 4 rows, with 4,2,2, & 1 windows successively 
  " top to bottom, with buffers empty.


  >> Populated Windows 

  :Tabwins            1211; $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin' 
  " Populate the buffers
  " => 'fill_content' specs of files are automatically opened via :edit,
  "    while specs of dirs are opened via :Explore
  " (Specify an '' empty string for windows intended to be empty.)

  :Tabwins           11111; $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin' 
  " Same buffer content, in different window structure, of 5 cols, 
  " one window in each.

  :TabwinsHorizontal 11111; $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin' 
  " Flip axis priority of above to the horizontal

  :Tabwins             312; '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '~/.git', $HOME, '/', '/usr/bin' 


  >> Symmetric Window Structures

  :V5x8 
  :H5x8 
  :V8x14 
  :H8x14 
  " Empty windows

  :V5x1 $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin' 
  " Structure & content same as :Tabwins 11111 above

  :V5   $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin' 
  " Same result again: since the secondary axis has only 1 
  " window for its dimensions, V5 is available as an even
  " shorter alias.


  >> Dimensions >9

  :Tabwins [ 5, 8, 13, 21 ] 
  " For a 4-column tab with 5, 8, 13, 21 windows successively left to right.

  :Tabwins [ 14, 14 ] 
  " Alternately, :V2x14

  :Tabwins [ 40, 30, 40, 30 ] 
  " For large monitors ...


  >> fill_specs with Multiple Commands

  :Tabwins 1112;  $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', 'Explore /usr/bin | resize 20' 
  " Does a :resize of the last window, via Vim '|' command concat.  If a file 
  " or dir is followed with concated commands, the caller needs to explicitly 
  " add the command that opens the file or dir, i.e. 'Explore' in this example.


  >> Tab Options

  :Tabwins 1211;  $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin'; 'ending_window_number' : 2 
  :Tabwins 1211;  $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin'; 'netrw_liststyle'      : 3 

  :Tabwins 1211;  $HOME, '~/.bashrc', '~/.vimrc', '/', '/usr/bin'; 'netrw_liststyle'      : 3, 'ending_window_number' : 2 
  " Multiple tab_options in same command.



TABWINS MENU

  Default settings load Vim menu Tabwins, for access to selected 
  tab-builder commands.  Those and additional tab builders are 
  available via Vim commands defined in tabwins.vim. The menu has 
  only a small portion of the tab builders defined in tabwins.vim.
